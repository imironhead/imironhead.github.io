* Use Depth CNN to predict the depth of I(t). **We do not have ground truth disparity** to do supervised learning on this network.
* Use Pose CNN to predict the pose of 3 cameras (inputs are I(t), I(t-1) and I(t+1)). **We do not have ground truth pose** to do supervised learning on this network, too.
* Use the depth from Depth CNN and the poses from Pose CNN to get to positions of P(t) on I(t-1) and I(t+1) (merely 3d re-projection).
* Use the difference between target P(t) and sources P(t-1) and P(t+1) as loss. Minimize the loss to train both Depth CNN and Pose CANN.
