I was in San Francisco for Google Next'17 and Drake told me: "you should talk in PyCon Taiwan."
It seemd to be a good idea except I had nothing to share.
Then KKBOX needed a speaker and I said yes before I had the topic.

Back to 2016, Andrew Ng gave this [advice](https://youtu.be/eyovmAtoUx0) in Bay Area Deep Learning School:

> These is one Phd student process that I find incredibly reliable.
> And I am gonna say it, and you may or may not trust it.
> But I have seen this work so reliabe so many times that I hope you take my word for it.
> That this process reliably turns non machine learning researchers into very good machine learning researchers.
> which is ... theres is no magic really.
> Read a lot of papers and work on replicating results.

It was the reason why I started to think about replacating results of papers. Then I found that
[Yann LeCun said](https://www.facebook.com/yann.lecun/posts/10153426023477143):

> Most of human and animal learning is unsupervised learning.
> If intelligence was a cake, unsupervised learning would be the cake,
> supervised learning would be the icing on the cake,
> and reinforcement learning would be the cherry on the cake.
> We know how to make the icing and the cherry, but we don't know how to make the cake.

I like cake so I start to read GAN papers which is about unsupervised learning. Before I had the topic for PyCon, I had already replicated DCGAN/EBGAN/XWGAN and gotten good results just like papers. Besides, I use Python only when doing deep learning. I had no choice, I had to talk about GANs. Fortunately, I enjoy the papers.
