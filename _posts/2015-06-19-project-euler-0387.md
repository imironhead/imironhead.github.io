# [Go to Problem](https://projecteuler.net/problem=387)

It’s easy since I spent only *30+* minutes. So try it before read my thought and you’ll have some fun.

* I ‘guess’ it would be very slow to check all primes one by one.
* [1..9] are all Harshad numbers (seeds).
* Take one seed, add one digit to it and check if it’s valid. For example, take 2, check [20..29]. All valid numbers are new seeds.
* Check if a new seed is also a strong Harshad number.
* If a seed is a strong Harshad number, append one digit to it and check if it’s a ‘strong, right truncatable Harshad primes’. For example, 201 is a strong Harshad number, check if [2010..2019] are primes.
* Sum all valid primes, done.
* This is actually a *tree* structure, solve it with *BFS*.
